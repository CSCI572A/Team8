Update 1

This week, our team did the following work:
1. We performed an investigation of the libraries that we should be utilizing in order to successfully detect the evil twin attack.
The following imports will likely be useful:
import subprocess
import pyshark
import os
import sys

We imagine that subprocess will be the most useful library as it provides very direct information about network connections and allows
us to perform analysis on commands. However, it is OS-specific, which will be necessary to include in our specification of the project.
We will likely stick with just Windows implementation. Both Abhaya and Paris did this.

2. We performed some initial testing on the subprocess library. We ran some necessary commands that were able to print the current
SSID and MAC address, as well as a lot of other identifying information which is obtained from the AP using the getmac command and the
netsh wlan show interfaces
command. We imagine that almost all of it will be valuable in the future. Paris wrote the code and Abhaya looked into more of the information on the libraries.

3. We did a bit of research and brainstorming on the evil twin attack and what information we will have to collect in order to detect
that the attack is happening. Abhaya and Paris worked on this.

4. Abhaya provided more information/brainstorming on system programming that would be associated with our project.

This progress lines up perfectly with the milestones in our proposal, as we imagined that the preliminary research of python libraries
for the task as well as some initial testing of them would make for a very great start to the project. We anticipate that
we will both get more work done next week as we are both a lot less busy then.
