Update 2

This week, our team did the following:

1. Abhaya performed more research on strategies present in the literature to mitigate the evil twin attack.
These include strategies from papers such as "Overview On Public Wi-Fi Security Threat Evil Twin Attack Detection"
and "An Efficient Scheme to Detect Evil Twin Rogue Access Point Attack in 802.11 Wi-Fi Networks" and
"Evil Twin Attack Detection using Discrete Event Systems in IEEE 802.11 Wi-Fi Networks." There are many more papers
with more solutions, which we will detail in our final report, but we wanted to find a paper that would give us a
solid idea of how Evil Twins can be detected and countered. Research was also done on what strategies attackers take to
perform these attacks.

2. We both met to discuss the research, and we ended up realizing that the solution that Paris was trying to implement,
which used key network features such as the SSID, MAC Address,
